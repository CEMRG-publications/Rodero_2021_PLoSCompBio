Code used to create the pipeline and analyze the results of [Rodero, C., Strocchi, M., Marciniak, M., Longobardi, S., Whitaker, J., Oâ€™Neill, M. D., ... & Niederer, S. A. (2021). Linking statistical shape models and simulated function in the healthy adult human heart. _PLoS computational biology_, 17(4), e1008851](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008851).

Each file has additional comments on what each function does. 

```master_script.sh``` has the pipeline all together (not guarantee that it's 100% functional), so it's a good place to start.
